# job-hunt

In looking for a new job, it can be difficult to keep track of where I've applied and the status of each application. So I decided to make a web application to help me.

I also realized that this could be a great opportunity to have a readily available example of my code. So rather than do the quick and dirty 1-hour job, I decided to go all-out and make something that was not only functional, but extensible and robust as well. I also figured it was about time I have a GitHub account.

While I realize there are numerous frameworks out there with thousands of man-hours spent in developing them, I wanted to build my own. I've never done it before. And so far it's been a good learning experience.

The only setup required should be to run the db_schema.sql file and to modify the database connection parameters found in DB.php.
